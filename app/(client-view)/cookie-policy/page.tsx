            What Are Cookies?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
            website owners to make their websites work, or to work more
            efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, GGW Capital) are
            called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the
            website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies
            enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or
            through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
            analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can
            recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question
            and also when it visits certain other websites.

            Why Do We Use Cookies?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
            cookies are required for technical reasons for our website to
            operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly
            necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the
            interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website.
            Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising,
